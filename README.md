# Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc-Analysis

As part of the codebasics  resume challenge, I have worked on this analysis project. 

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains the code and SQL queries used for the Consumer Goods domain as a part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics. In this project, I have worked with a dataset related to consumer goods. The challenge was to empower the management with valuable insights using MySQL and to address ad hoc requests using SQL queries.  

The dataset used in this project belongs to "AtliQ Hardwares", one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too. 

**Skills Learnt:** 

1.SQL Query Writing using CTE, rank, joins, date functions, sub-queries and numeric functions 

2.Data Extraction and Transformation 

3.Data Analysis and Interpretation 

4.Report Generation 

5.Problem Solving and Decision Making
